// what is Node.js Modules=>
// Node.js Modules are blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with external application on basis of their related functionality.
// Module can be a single file or multiple files/folders. The Reason programmer are heavily reliant on modules is because
// of their re-usability as well as the ability to break down a complex peice of code into managable code.

// Modules are three types-
//1.Core Modules
//2.Local Modules
//3.Third-Party Modules

//1.Core Modules=> Built-in modules are called core modules that is cames with node.js installation.There modules are used by using require function
// const mymodule= require('module_name')
// const http=require('http')

//example => http, assert, fs, path, process, os, querystring, url etc.


//2.Local Modules => external modules that is created by user in node.js applition that is called local modules 
//example => 
//exports.add=function(x,y){
//     return x + y;
// };


//3.Third-Party Modules =>
// A module that is used by installing online using NPM that is installed in project folder or globally that is called third part modules.
